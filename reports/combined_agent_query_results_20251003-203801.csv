Object Type Confirmation: I will use 'vim.VirtualMachine' as specified, which is the correct object type for querying VM capabilities and configurations. \n3. Property Selection: The properties needed to fulfill this intent include capability.perVmEvcSupported, which indicates if a VM has Per-VM EVC configurations, and summary.currentEVCModeKey to understand the current EVC state. \n4. Filter Strategy: I will filter for VMs where capability.perVmEvcSupported is equal to 'false' (indicating that EVC is not configured) and also add a filter to ensure that the summary.currentEVCModeKey is equal to 'none' to identify that they require cross-cluster mobility. \n5. Execution Process: The query will be executed to retrieve all VMs, ensuring that only those matching the specified filters are returned.  These filters will ensure we get the right VMs. \n6.

**Summary:**
In the VMware environment, several entities have been assessed for compliance. The majority of VMs, hosts, networks, and datastores are compliant with a green status. However, multiple key entities, including datacenter, host, and various other components, display a gray status indicating potential compliance issues that may need further investigation.","data: {""type"": ""connected"", ""data"": {""message"": ""Streaming started""}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759399366.0554502}

Intent Analysis: The user is requesting an overall security compliance summary, which typically involves examining different components in the VMware environment, such as VMs, hosts, datastores, and network configurations. This requires retrieving static states or statuses that indicate compliance levels. \n2. Object Type Confirmation: Since no specific object type was provided, I will use the 'vim.ManagedEntity' type, which is the base type for all inventory objects in vCenter and serves a broad purpose. \n3. Property Selection: I will select several properties relevant to security compliance, including 'name', 'overallStatus', and 'configStatus', as these will give insights into the compliance statuses of the managed entities. \n4. Filter Strategy: Filtering is not required for this request, as per the user's instructions, which means the query will retrieve all relevant managed entities and their compliance statuses without any additional conditions. \n5. Execution Process: I will execute a query through pyVmomi using the parameters defined in this plan, specifically targeting the vim.ManagedEntity type, to gather the compliance-related properties. \n6. Data Validation: I will ensure that the results contain a comprehensive overview of the compliance statuses across the different managed entities. Each entity\u2019s status will be analyzed for relevance to compliance. \n7. Output Format: The returned data will be structured to reflect the names and compliance statuses of managed entities, providing the user with a clear summary of overall security compliance."", ""steps"": [{""params"": {""vsphere_object_type"": ""vim.ManagedEntity"", ""properties"": [""name"", ""overallStatus"", ""configStatus""], ""filters"": []}}]}, ""timestamp"": 1759399377.4656122}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759399377.4657266}

### Summary:
- **Overall Posture**: There are numerous entities within the vCenter environment with a good number showing a green overall status, indicating readiness for migration.
- **Gray Entities**: A few key entities such as the datacenter, vm, host, datastore, and network are currently marked as gray, suggesting potential issues or unconfigured states that may need to be addressed before proceeding with cross-vCenter migration.
- **Migration Readiness**: Entities with an overall green status signal that they are configured and ready, including various ESXi hosts, clusters, and workloads indicating adequate resources. 

It's imperative to resolve the gray status entities for successful cross-vCenter migration.","data: {""type"": ""connected"", ""data"": {""message"": ""Streaming started""}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759400856.6286318}

Intent Analysis: The user seeks information about prerequisites and version compatibility for Cross-Center functionality in VMware environments, which pertains to configuration and compatibility data across VMware's infrastructure. This suggests a need for an appropriate inventory or managed entity type. 2. Object Type Confirmation: As there is no specific vSphere object type provided for this user query, I will use 'vim.ManagedEntity', which covers a broad range of virtual entities in vCenter. 3. Property Selection: Selecting common properties from the ManagedEntity type. Properties like 'name' and 'overallStatus' are necessary to retrieve key identification and status information that may relate to version compatibility. 4. Filter Strategy: No filtering is needed as indicated by the user request, so the filters list will remain empty. 5. Execution Process: The query will be executed using the properties selected without any filters. This approach will allow fetching all pertinent managed entities that may relate to Cross-Center functionality. 6. Data Validation: Upon receiving the data, it will be checked to ensure it contains relevant information aligned with the user's request concerning prerequisites and compatibility against VMware's standards. 7.

### Summary
- **Virtual Machines**: There are a total of 34 VMs listed with their power states and resource pools (all showing null values for these properties).
- **Datastores**: Two datastores are recorded, with one significantly larger in terms of both capacity and free space.
- **Clusters**: There are 2 clusters, both with green status and a total of 8 hosts combined.
- **Resource Pools**: Six resource pools are identified, with varying amounts of configured memory, some showing zero configuration.

Summary:
There are numerous managed entities retrieved, with various statuses. Significant insights include that most entities are in a ""green"" status, indicating they are functioning properly, while a few entities, including the datacenter, host, vm, and datastore, are in a ""gray"" state, possibly requiring attention or further investigation.","data: {""type"": ""connected"", ""data"": {""message"": ""Streaming started""}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759402454.0239341}

Summary:
The current snapshot of RBAC principals includes various roles with numerous associated privileges across different categories such as System, Trusted Infrastructure, Host, Global, Folder, Datacenter, and others, totaling over 580 privileges detailed from the vSphere environment. Each role can manage distinct functions that encompass security, availability, and resource management aspects in the virtual infrastructure.","data: {""type"": ""connected"", ""data"": {""message"": ""Streaming started""}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759402612.899744}

Object Type Confirmation: The user query involves retrieving data from the Event and Authorization managers; thus, I will utilize both 'vim.EventManager' and 'vim.AuthorizationManager' as the relevant object types. \n3. Property Selection: For 'vim.EventManager', I will retrieve key properties like 'createdTime', 'userName', and 'fullFormattedMessage' to identify change events related to user roles. For 'vim.AuthorizationManager', I will select 'roleList' and 'privilegeList' to ascertain the roles and privileges assigned. \n4. Filter Strategy: I will apply a filter for 'vim.EventManager' to limit events to those created within the last 7 days by using the 'time' property. Additionally, I will filter 'vim.AuthorizationManager' to look specifically for any role changes or privilege assignments. \n5. Execution Process: The EventManager's QueryEvents method will be invoked for recent event retrieval with appropriate filters, while the AuthorizationManager will be queried for current role and privilege assignments. \n6. Data Validation: Results will be verified to ensure they correspond with the correct timeframe of role changes and accurately reflect the users who gained admin rights. \n7. Output Format: The final output will be structured, presenting user names, event timestamps, and messages indicating role changes within the specified timeframe."", ""steps"": [{""params"": {""vsphere_object_type"": ""vim.EventManager"", ""properties"": [""createdTime"", ""userName"", ""fullFormattedMessage""], ""filters"": [""time >= '2025-09-26T00:00:00Z'"", {""eventTypeId"": ""UserRoleChanged""}]}}, {""params"": {""vsphere_object_type"": ""vim.AuthorizationManager"", ""properties"": [""roleList"", ""privilegeList""], ""filters"": [{""roleList.name"": ""Admin""}, {""privilegeList.privilege"": ""Add""}]}}]}, ""timestamp"": 1759503948.7812922}, ""session_id"": ""1"", ""timestamp"": 1759503948.7814033}
